Virtualization

In computing, Virtualization refers to the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something.
This includes virtual computer hardware, virtual storage devices and virtual network ressources.

Levels of Virtualization

    Virtualization at Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Level

        Every machine has an instuction set. This Instruction set is an interface between software and hardwar. Using this instuction software can communicate with hardware
                    
    Virtualization at Operating System (O.S.) level

        In Virtualization at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratch i.e. by installing O.S., application suites, networking systems, etc

        In cloud sometimes, we need to initialize 100 virtual machines at a single time, if we use Virtualization at Hardware abstraction layer (HAL) level this can take too much time.
        So, to overcome this in Virtualization at Operating system level we share operating system between Virtual machines along with the hardware.
